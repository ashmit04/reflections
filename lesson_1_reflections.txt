was introduced?

commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


A good rule of thumb is to make one commit per logical change
  For example, if you fixed a typo, then fixed a bug in a separate part of the file, you should use one commit for each change since they are logically separate

commit is a snapshot of the repository.

git checkout is not same as SVN Checkout
git checkout = restore the repository to a previous commit


git init- initalize the repo..When you initialize the repository, Git doesn’t create any commits for you. You’ll have to create the first commit yourself.

git status --shows which file have changed since last commit
